👋  Hej välkommen på [AgileSearch](agilesearch) fullstack challenge!

My name is Broodar Plawind and I'm living in a far far away solar system located in the Arkanis sector of the Outer Rim Territories, in the Tatooine desert.

I'm would love to spend the next months travelling around the universe, my idea is to visit and stay at least 15 days on the planets that I always dreamed about: Naboo, Mandalore and Hoth.

Could you help me to get the right spaceship tickets for me? I'm afraid that I'm not good enough with today's technology and I don't know where to start.
